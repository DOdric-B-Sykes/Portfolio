                    <p>My name is D'Odric B. Sykes, but my friends and family call me Dio. I was born and raised in
                        Dallas, TX but I currently reside on the outskirts of Houston, TX in a town called League
                        City.For a number of years I worked in Sports Medicine before ultimately making the switch to
                        tech.</p>

                    <p> I have always had a love for all things tech, specifically coding. My general interest in all
                        things tech started with my love for video games and grew over the years to include app and web
                        development, which has lead me to pursuing a career in web design and development and currently
                        hold skills in using HTML, CSS, Git, Command Line, Javascript and React.
